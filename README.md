# pseudo-git
A proof of concept git like version control. Digging deep on how it works

### To do:
-[] initite using something like e.g. python3 pseudo.py -edit file.txt
-[] track changes by comparing checksums and saving every file whenever we do, e.g. python3 pseudo.py -save file.txt, on a local database, might use sql lite or database.c
-[] need to display a comprehensive history of every -save just like in the real git where you can view the previous commits and the changes done with the file.
